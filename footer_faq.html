            </p>

            <p>
                To use your promotion or coupon code, enter the code at checkout in the appropriate field. Make sure you enter the code with the exact spelling and capitalization as shown. You must click "apply" in

    </p>
            <strong>How long does it take to personalize a jersey?</strong>
            <p>
                The time it takes to personalize a jersey varies because they need to be shipped to the screen printer before being shipped to you. Typically, the personalization process adds an additional 5 to 7 days to
    the order's processing time before it is ready for shipment.
            </p>
            <strong>When will I receive shipping confirmation for my personalized jersey order?</strong>
            <p>
                After placing your order, the jersey will be sent to the screen printer for personalization. Once the personalization has been added, you will receive a shipping confirmation with the details of your
    shipment.
            </p>
            <strong>Can I return a personalized jersey if I change my mind?</strong>
            <p>
                No, personalized jerseys cannot be returned unless they are defective or faulty. If you believe your personalized jersey is defective or faulty, please contact our customer service team here. Common
    issues can include printing errors, fabric defects, or incorrect personalization details.
