                        You and we agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and we may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and we may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or we may participate in a class-wide settlement. Nothing in these Terms precludes you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local government agencies and, if the applicable law allows, such agencies may seek relief against us for you.
