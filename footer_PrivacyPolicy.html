                    <p>Additionally, some of our service providers and vendors including, without limitation, customer service vendors may utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”) to provide you with user-friendly and responsive feedback.

We, and third parties, may also use technologies, such as our own, and third party, cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. Furthermore, when using Data Technologies from our advertising partners such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others, we may use an “advanced matching” feature, in which data such as name, address, email address, telephone number, social media ID and browsing behavior is collected and shared with those partners in a pseudonymous manner in order to serve you advertising that is relevant to you based on your interactions with us. You can opt out of this collection and sharing by selecting Manage Cookies in the footer and opting out of Social Media and Advertising cookies or by adjusting your browser settings.</p>

In some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember Services preferences you have selected. These cookies also help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to all of our visitors and what promotions visitors like to see, and to gauge the success of our advertising campaigns. Refusing these cookies will limit recommendations and customizations while using the Services.

Advertising cookies collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your Personal Information.

                        Some information about your use of the Services and certain other online services may be collected using Data Technologies across time and services and used by PUMA and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain other online services. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, PUMA currently does not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a> , but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties may, however, offer you choices regarding their tracking technologies. PUMA is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third-party notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see below. We may, from time-to-time, and in certain jurisdictions, offer or point you to tools that allow you to exercise certain preferences regarding cookies and other Data Technologies associated with the Services, but such tools rely on third parties and third party information so we do not guaranty that the tools will provide complete and accurate information or be completely effective.

                        Some advertising and technology partners may also collect Personal Information when you use the Services. For example, we may work with other companies, such as Google, who use tracking technologies to analyze how users use the Services and to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. For more information about how data is collected and processed in connection with the Google Analytics service and how to opt out, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.

                        Some third party Data Technology operators that may be associated with our Services may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (

Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see 
                            <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> . Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g. from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g. mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
